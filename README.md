## Goal

An example page is given. It shows the same control, working through Blade, Inertia and pure React. You can use the Network tab of Developer Tools to see the differences in updates

- Pure Blade returns HTML, requires manual DOM manipulation
- Inertia returns DOM adjustments as a JSON file
- Pure React has no communication with server
